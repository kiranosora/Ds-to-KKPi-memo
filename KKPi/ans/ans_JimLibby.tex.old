\begin{itemize}
    \item 1.
        However, why not fit Fig 11 from the MIPWA with $|A(f0) + ae^{delta} A(a0)|^{2}$, where A(f0) and A(a0) are based on Eq. 11. This will give you a different parameterization to try in the amplitude fit. I am really not sure about this S(980) object as it is not physical.
