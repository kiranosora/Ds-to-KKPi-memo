    \item 1.
        However, why not fit Fig 11 from the MIPWA with $|A(f0) + ae^{delta} A(a0)|^{2}$, where A(f0) and A(a0) are based on Eq. 11. This will give you a different parameterization to try in the amplitude fit. I am really not sure about this S(980) object as it is not physical.

            As a0 and f0 is so close that I think it is not appropriate to describe them with the sum of them.
            I think here we should use K-matrix formalism. 
            The formalism used here is
            \begin{equation}
                \begin{array}{lr}
                    \hat{T} = (I - i\hat{K}\rho)^{-1} \hat{K}&\\
                    \hat{K} = \frac{m_{\alpha}\Gamma_{\alpha}}{m_{\alpha}^{2} - m_{\alpha}^{2}} + \frac{m_{\beta}\Gamma_{\beta}}{m_{\beta}^{2} - m_{\beta}^{2}}, &
                \end{array}\label{K-matrix} 
            \end{equation}

            Then fit the S wave shape with $|\hat{T}|^{2}$, the result is shown in Fig.~\ref{K-matrix-Fit}.
