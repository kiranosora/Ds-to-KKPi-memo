\abstracttext{
  We have performed an amplitude analysis of  $D_{s}^{+} \rightarrow K^{+}K^{-}\pi^{+}$ using a data sample of $3.19fb^{-1}$ recorded with BESIII detector at 1.178GeV. 4265 events with about \%0.5 background are used in this analysis. There are 6 intermediate resonances in the model which does the best fit to data. Especially, $a_{0}(980)$ and $f_{0}(980)$ are taken as a whole.
