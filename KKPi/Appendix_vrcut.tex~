\section{Substract of the Secondary proton}

A sizable of (anti-)proton candidates are produced from the electron/positron beam or particles in final states interacting with the MDC inner wall or residual gas inside beam-pipe, especially for proton. Here, we take the decay mode $\lambdacp \to p\eta(\gamma\gamma)$ as an example. Fig.~\ref{PreviousAnalyses} shows the compared $V_{\rm{r}}$ distributions of proton and anti-proton in different samples. In this analysis, we use the scaled inclusive MC to optimize the tight requirement with the $/\sqrt{S+B}$ curve. Fig.~\ref{PreviousAnalyses} shows the efficiency distribution and $S/\sqrt{S+B}$ distribution with different $V_{\rm{r}}$ requirement. Where, $S$ represents signal events, and $B$ is scaled inclusive MC sample.
%In this analysis, we refer Panyue's study~\cite{2016panyue} on the $V_{\rm{r}}$ requirement optimization, and set the tight $V_{\rm{r}}$ requirement within 2 cm for both proton and anti-proton.
