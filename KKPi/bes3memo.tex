\abstracttext{
  We have performed an amplitude analysis of $D_{s}^{+} \rightarrow K^{+}K^{-}\pi^{+}$ using a data sample of $3.19fb^{-1}$ recorded with BESIII detector at a center-of-mass energy of 4.178GeV. 
  About 4000 events are used in amplitude analysis. 
  There are 6 intermediate resonances in the model which does the best fit to data. 
  %We tent to agree the Dalitz plot analysis of $D_{s}^{+} \rightarrow K^{+}K^{-}\pi^{+}$ by BABAR.
  And we also measured the branching fraction of   $D_{s}^{+} \rightarrow K^{+}K^{-}\pi^{+}$ and the result is $\mathcal{B}(D_{s}^{+} \rightarrow K^{+}K^{-}\pi^{+})=(5.38\pm0.07_{stat.}\pm0.11_{sys.})\%$.
