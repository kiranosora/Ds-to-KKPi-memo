\abstracttext{
  We report the amplitude analysis and branching fraction measurement of $D_{s}^{+} \rightarrow K^{+}K^{-}\pi^{+}$ decay using a data sample of 3.19 $\rm fb^{-1}$ recorded with BESIII detector at a center-of-mass energy of 4.178 GeV. 
  We perform a model-independent partial wave analysis (MIPWA) in the low $K^{+}K^{-}$ region to extract the $K^{+}K^{-}$ $\mathcal{S}$-wave lineshape. 
  We also perform an amplitude analysis on a nearly background free sample of 4399 events to investigate the substructure, and determine the relative fractions and the phases among the different intermediate processes.
  The amplitude analysis results provide an accurate detection efficiency and allow measuement of the branching fraction of $D_{s}^{+} \rightarrow K^{+}K^{-}\pi^{+}$ to be $\mathcal{B}(D_{s}^{+} \rightarrow K^{+}K^{-}\pi^{+})=(5.47\pm0.07_{stat.}\pm0.13_{sys.})\%$.
  %About 4000 events are used in amplitude analysis. 
  %Amplitudes and phases contributing to this final state are measured. 
  %And we also measure the branching fraction of   $D_{s}^{+} \rightarrow K^{+}K^{-}\pi^{+}$ to be $\mathcal{B}(D_{s}^{+} \rightarrow K^{+}K^{-}\pi^{+})=(5.47\pm0.07_{stat.}\pm0.13_{sys.})\%$.
