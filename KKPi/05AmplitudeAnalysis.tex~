\section{Amplitude Analysis}

\subsection{Fit Method}
\par{The method used in amplitude analysis is the same as the Ref.~\cite{Doc-DB-416-v30}. In this section, we briefly review the amplitude analysis method used int this analysis.
    
    The relative magnitudes and phases of the partial waves and the mass and width of intermediate resonances are determined by a maximum-likelihood fit to the data selected. The formulas are constructed with covariant tensors ~\cite{covariant-tensors}.

    Since there are three final state particles, only one possible resonant state is allowed in any intermediate process. Thus the amplitude of the $n^{th}$ intermediate state ($A_{n}$) is,
    \begin{equation}
    A_{n} = P_{n}S_{n}F_{n}^{r}F_{n}^{D}, \label{base-amplitude}
    \end{equation}
where $S_{n}$ and $F_{n}^{r(D)}$ are the spin factor and the Blatt-Weisskopf barriers of the intermediate state (the $D_{s}$ meson), respectively. $P_{n}$ is the propagator of the intermediate resonance. For a decay process $a \rightarrow bc$, $s_{a/b/c}$ is denoted to be the invariant mass square of the particle a/b/c, and q is denoted as the magnitude of the momentum daughter particle in the rest system of a
    \begin{equation}
    q=\sqrt{ \frac{(s_{a} + s_{b} + s_{c})^{2}}{4s_{a}} - s_{b}}. \label{base-q}
    \end{equation}
    
    Then for $K^{*}(892)^{0}$, $\Phi(1020)^{0}$, $K_{0}^{*}(1430)^{0}$ and  $f_{0}(1710)$, they are parameterized as a RBW,
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{array}{lr}
            P = \frac{1}{(m_{0}^{2} - s_{a} ) - im_{0}\Gamma(m)}, &\\
            \Gamma(m) = \Gamma_{0}\left(\frac{q}{q_{0}}\right)^{3}\left(\frac{m_{0}}{m}\right)\left(F^{r}\right)^{2}, &
        \end{array}\label{RBW} 
    \end{equation}
    where $m_{0}$ and $\Gamma_{0}$ are the mass and the width of the intermediate resonances, and are fixed to the PDG values ~\cite{PDG2018} except the mass and the widtch of $f_{0}(1370)$. The mass and width of $f_{0}(1370)$ are fixed to Ref.~\cite{para-f01370}.
$K^{*}_{0}(1430)^{0}$ is parameterized with Flatte formula:
    \begin{equation}
        P_{K^{*}_{0}(1430)^{0}}= \frac{1}{M^{2} - s - i(g_{1}\rho_{K\pi}(s) + g_{2}\rho_{\eta^{'}K}(s))}, \label{Flatte}
    \end{equation}
    where $s$ is the $K^{-}\pi^{+}$ invariant mass squared,  $\rho_{K\pi}(s)$ and $\rho_{\eta^{'}K}(s)$ are Lorentz invariant PHSP factor, and   $g_{1,2}$ are coupling constants to the corresponding final state. The parameters of $K^{*}_{0}(1430)^{0}$ are fixed to values measured by CLEO ~\cite{CLEO-Flatte}. For resonance $f_{0}(980)$ \& $a_{0}(980)$, the RBW form \ref{a0980-RBW} is used to describe the propagator and the values of parameters are fixed to the values in \ref{S-wave parameters}.
    
    The Blatt-Weisskopf barriers are given by 
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{array}{lr}
            F_{n} = 1           (S wave), &\\
            F_{n} = \sqrt{\frac{z_{0}^{2}+1}{z^{2}+1}}          (P wave), &\\
            F_{n} = \sqrt{\frac{z_{0}^{4}+3z_{0}^{2}+9}{z^{4}+3z^{2}+9}}       (D wave), &
        \end{array}\label{Blatt-Weisskopf barrier} 
    \end{equation}
    where $z$ and $z_{0}$ are $qR$ and $q_{0}R$, respectively. The R is the effective radius of the intermediate state or $D_{s}$ meson and set to $3.0GeV^{-1}$ for intermediate states and $5.0GeV^{-1}$  for $D_{s}$ meson ~\cite{Doc-DB-416-v30}, respectively.
